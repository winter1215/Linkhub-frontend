#### Add local messages to avoid network errors that send the same message repeatedly

In a low-speed network, when the message is sent, it will be displayed on the screen immediately to the message list, which is displayed semi-transparently. When the sending is successful, it will be corrected to the normal display according to the returned content.

#### Optimize the prompt for unprocessed friend requests

When there is an unprocessed friend request, it will be prompted in the sidebar and navigation bar at this time to ensure that users will not miss information
