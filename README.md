## Next generation noIM application in your own workspace

### Not only another `Slack`, `Discord`, `Rocket.Chat`....

If you are interested in the concept of `noIM`, welcome to read my blog:
- [It's time to officially step into the era of noIM](https://tailchat.msgbyte.com/blog/2023/03/01/the-era-of-noIM)

Official Documentation: [https://tailchat.msgbyte.com/](https://tailchat.msgbyte.com/)

**Nightly version** Try it online: [https://nightly.paw.msgbyte.com/](https://nightly.paw.msgbyte.com/)

> Nightly version is the automatic compile version, that means, every commit code will be automatically compiled.
> The reliability and stability of the data are not guaranteed, you can deploy with stable version with docker images or github release page

## Motivation

At present, the existing IM applications only focus on chatting itself, and IM is naturally a multi-person collaboration method. In my opinion, it should be able to take on more responsibilities, and form its own unique way of forwarding external applications through IM workflow.

Therefore, I bring up the point of `noIM`, which means **Not only IM**. Instead, it designed a highly customized application platform for individuals/teams centered on IM, with third-party applications as enhanced functions, and a plugin system as the glue connection layer in the middle.

To this end, the functions were abstracted, and a lot of time was spent designing the underlying mechanism. An instant messaging application such as `Tailchat` was born for expansion from the beginning of the underlying design. Through `Tailchat`'s plugin system, developers can easily use their favorite applications as part of `Tailchat` in a very natural way. Different from traditional integration methods such as `Slack`, the integration of `Tailchat` is more free, as if it is a native function.

## Feature

- Pay attention to privacy, only invited members can join the group
- Prevent strangers, add friends only by nickname + a random string of numbers
- Two-level group space, dividing different topics by panels
- Highly customized group space, create original group space by grouping with dragging and dropping. At the same time, more plugins can be used to add more capabilities
- It can be rigorous or fun. Through the combination of plugins, `Tailchat` can be created for different scenarios. It can be for individuals or for enterprises
- The backend microservice structure is ready for large-scale deployment. Don't worry about what to do after the number of user growth

## Performance and Expansion

Tailchat is a modern open source IM application which based on **React** + **Typescript**

Front-end microkernel architecture + backend microservice architecture, `Tailchat` is ready for clustering deployment.

The front end empowers the application through the plugin system, which is very simple and easy to expand for the secondary development of `Tailchat`.

**NOTICE: Although the core functionality of Tailchat is currently in a stable stage, its exposed interface for third-party developers is still being improved. Generally speaking, it is backward compatible, but retains the possibility of Break Change**
