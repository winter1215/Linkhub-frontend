The demonstration environment is to reflect the performance of `Tailchat` on a low-configuration server (less resource occupation is the key requirement of Tailchat). The server in the test environment is 1C2G1M (1 cpu core, 2g memory space, 1mb bandwidth limit).

Also, here are some groups for demonstrating Tailchat functionality:

- [Tailchat Nightly](https://nightly.paw.msgbyte.com/invite/8Jfm1dWb)
- [Genshin](https://nightly.paw.msgbyte.com/invite/GFFzfD5H)
