## Learn MiniStar

`MiniStar` is a complete microkernel architecture development toolchain, and the plugin architecture of `Tailchat` is developed based on `MiniStar`.

Learn more about `MiniStar`, you can check the official documentation of `MiniStar`: [https://ministar.moonrailgun.com/](https://ministar.moonrailgun.com/)

## Create a base project


import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="start">
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Use the cli to quick start" default>

> First, make sure you have installed `tailchat-cli`, for command line tools, please refer to: [tailchat-cli](../cli/tailchat-cli)

Move to the project directory (can be a custom project):

```bash
tailchat create
```

Choose the template according to the actual situation

![](/img/tutorial/plugin/1.png)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ministar" label="Use the native ministar to create a plugin project" default>


First, create a basic npm project and install `MiniStar` globally

```bash
npm install --global mini-star
```

Execute: `ministar createPlugin` in the project to create a basic plugin

Execute: `ministar buildPlugin` in the project to compile the plugin

> It is worth mentioning that although `Tailchat` does not enforce the naming convention of plugins, it is still recommended to use `anti-domain name` naming method (similar to package naming in java), and then use `/` for the components in the plugin to split
>
> such as:
>
> Plugin name: `com.msgbyte.webview`
>
> Registration content: `com.msgbyte.webview/grouppanel`

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Install Plugin

### Manually install plugin

Without any presets, a general method is to construct a `manifest` configuration by yourself, and then paste the configuration file into the tab of `tailchat` to provide manual installation plug-ins for installation.

The url path of the plugin can be proxied through methods such as `oss object storage service` / `static-server`

An example `manifest.json` configuration is as follows:

```json
{
  "label": "Web Panel Plugin",
  "name": "com.msgbyte.webview",
  "url": "/plugins/com.msgbyte.webview/index.js",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "author": "msgbyte",
  "description": "Provides groups with the ability to create web panels",
  "requireRestart": false
}
```
