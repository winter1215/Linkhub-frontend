After clicking submit, all users will immediately display a global announcement on the page, as follows:

Users can click the close button on the far right to close this notification.

In addition, if the content of the announcement is more complicated, you can also choose to add an announcement link. When the link is not empty, a **Learn More** button will be displayed on the announcement.

#### Admin cache management optimization

Subdivided Admin's cache management because we realized that it would be very brute force for administrator to update the client's configuration only by modifying environment variables, but only by clearing all caches.

Therefore, we subdivided the cache management and extracted the function of cleaning the client cache separately
