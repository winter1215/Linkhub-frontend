The icon solution for `tailchat` comes from `iconify`

The way of use is very simple:
- Select the desired icon from the following website: [https://icon-sets.iconify.design/](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/)
- Duplicate the selected key. Pass to `Icon` component, example:
```tsx
<Icon icon="mdi:account" />
```
