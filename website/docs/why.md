The design of `Tailchat` is to use a plug-in architecture to meet different needs of different groups of people.

## For personal

  - Create a group
  - Divide different topics through multiple channels
  - Use the web panel to share favorite web pages
- If you want to gather your own fandom
   - Use bots to subscribe to your own messages and forward them to the chat panel
   - Let your fans gather together without creating countless qq groups/WeChat groups
   - Multiple channels allow multiple topics to be generated together
- If you are very fancy about your privacy
   - Self-host to keep everything under control

## For enterprise
